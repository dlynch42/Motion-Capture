# Motion-Capture

Using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python, I was able to get the points of a human model as it moved through a 2D video. Using the points in each frame, I coded an animation text file. Through C#, I created points in Unity based off the x, y, and z coordinates for each object given in the file. That way the points created a 3D model and moved with the corresponding frames.
